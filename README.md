# Chaos Spear
A practice tool for Shadow Generations.

**THIS IS NOT A MOD, THIS IS A SEPARATE PROGRAM**

## Features:
- Save and load position and rotation, with 10 slots for storing data.
- Save and load positions to and from JSON files.
- Give yourself 999 rings at any time.
- View your current speed, both as a single horizontal speed value and as a vector of all 3 values.
- Charge Chaos Control at any time.
- Turn on an infinite boost cheat at any time.

## How to download:
- Download the .zip folder from the most recent release, and unzip it.

  **OR**

- Clone this repository, and build the program yourself using the .NET framework.

## How to use:
- Load Chaos Spear by running Chaos_Spear.exe, and load Shadow Generations at the same time.
- When both are open and running, click the attach button on Chaos Spear. It should change to say detach. If successful, Chaos Spear is now linked to the game. Don't attach during loading screens you will crash the game :)
- Once in a playable level (e.g. White Space, a boss, a main stage etc.), use the Save Position button to save Shadow's current position. Choose a save slot to save to using the dropdown labelled "Save position to slot:". Saving to a slot with data already in it will overwrite that data, so be careful!
- Use the Load Position button to load the position data saved in the current load slot. Choose a slot to load to using the dropdown labelled "Load position from slot:". All empty slots default to 0, 0, 0. There's no need to worry about loading from an empty slot.
- Use the 999 Rings button to immediately grant yourself 999 rings.
- Use the infinte boost button to activate an infinite boost cheat
- Use the CC charge button to instantly grant yourself a charge of Chaos Control
- Use the Save to JSON button to save all of your current slots to a JSON file.
- Use the "Load from JSON" button to load the data from the file selected in the dropdown.
